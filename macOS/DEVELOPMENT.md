These are the environment configuration files for Unix-like shells on macOS:

The .bash_profile file: This is the environment configuration file for the Bash Unix-like shell on macOS. It contains commands that are executed when you log in to a Bash session or a new Terminal session. This file is typically located in the user's home directory and its full name is ".bash_profile".

The .zshrc file: This is the environment configuration file for the Zsh Unix-like shell on macOS. It contains commands that are executed when you open a Zsh session or a new Terminal session. This file is typically located in the user's home directory and its full name is ".zshrc".

The .zprofile file: This is the environment configuration file for the Zsh Unix-like shell on macOS. It contains commands that are executed when you log in to a Zsh session or a new Terminal session. This file is similar to .bash_profile, however, it is only used in Zsh login sessions. This file is typically located in the user's home directory and its full name is ".zprofile".
